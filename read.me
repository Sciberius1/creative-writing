Thank you for reviewing this little project of mine. I am trying to use what little coding skills I have to add some interactivity to my creative writing. I hope you like it. If you run into any errors or bugs please let me know. If you find a spelling error or something that sounds off, other than the middle finger to the metrics system, give me some feedback and let me know. Interested in having a character named after you? Want to help me pic some music for the next chapter, or are you wanting to have a mythology assigned to a fleet? Let me know, I am always open to creative ideas.

Thanks,

Sciberius
